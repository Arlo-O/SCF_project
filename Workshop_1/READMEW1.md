# Workshop-1

This folder contains all artifacts related to **Workshop No.1 – Systems Design**, part of the *Systems Sciences Foundations* course at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to document the **initial system design** of an intelligent traffic light coordination system. It includes the foundational analysis and modeling of a cybernetic agent that controls two consecutive traffic lights using reinforcement learning techniques.

This design lays the groundwork for future workshops, where simulation, training, and implementation will take place.
