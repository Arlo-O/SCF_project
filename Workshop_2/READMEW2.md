# Autonomous Traffic Light Control Agent - Analysis and Modeling

This folder contains resources related to the **analysis and modeling** of an autonomous agent for traffic light control, drawing upon concepts from dynamic systems and reinforcement learning. This work builds the theoretical foundation for the development of an intelligent traffic management system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to document the **dynamic modeling and initial agent design considerations** for an intelligent traffic light control system. It includes a mathematical representation of traffic flow and explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques for autonomous control.

This analysis and modeling phase sets the stage for future development, simulation, and potential real-world implementation.
