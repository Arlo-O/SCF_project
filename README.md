# Intelligent Traffic Light Controller 🚦

This repository contains the full development of a simulated intelligent traffic light control system using **reinforcement learning**. The project is developed as part of the *Systems Sciences Foundations* course at **Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas** (2025-I semester).

## 🧠 Project Objective

To design and implement a **cybernetic agent** capable of managing two consecutive traffic lights on a simulated main street. The agent will learn through reinforcement learning techniques to optimize vehicle and pedestrian flow by adapting to changing traffic conditions.
